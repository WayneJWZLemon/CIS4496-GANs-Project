## Project Description
**This capstone project is instructed by Professor Abha Belorkar and teaching assistant Sam Black at [Temple University’s College of Science and Technology](https://cst.temple.edu/)**

This project adapts ideas from the [I’m Something of a Painter Myself Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/gan-getting-started/overview) to develop machine learning models that can effectively convert input photos to Monet-style paintings and potentially styles of other artists.
